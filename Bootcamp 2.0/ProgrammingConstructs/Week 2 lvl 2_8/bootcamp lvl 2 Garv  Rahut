      // Prompt the user to enter three double values
      System.out.print("Enter the first number (a): ");
      double a = scanner.nextDouble();
      System.out.print("Enter the second number (b): ");
      double b = scanner.nextDouble();
      System.out.print("Enter the third number (c): ");
      double c = scanner.nextDouble();
      // Perform double precision operations considering operator precedence
      double result1 = a + b * c; // Multiplication has higher precedence than addition
      double result2 = a * b + c; // Multiplication first, then addition
      double result3 = c + a / b; // Division first, then addition
      double result4 = a % b + c; // Modulus first, then addition
      // Display the results
      System.out.println("The results of Double Operations are " + result1 + ", " + result2
+ ", " + result3 + " and " + result4 + ".");
